    #I was excited to join the program and I can tell that Dr. Taniya Mishra and all the mentors made a lot of effort on this program. I learned how to download Jupter Notebook and how to use it for Python programming. I heard Numpy and TensorFlow before but I did not know what they were but I kinda have a better knowledge of them today. The one-to-one meeting with my mentor Shoumik Majumdar was so great that he gave a more clear picture of deep learning. 
    A new learning journy starts and let's go!

    #I have never thought that story telling has such a great power to build connections and break barriers before, and I did not realize that story telling skill is a part of leadership until I joined Dr. David Kong's workshop today. Good stories help us overcome the negative emotions such as self-doubt and fear, and bring us hope and courage, which is the power of our heart. I know many excellent leaders are good at public speech but I ignored the skill of story telling that they used in their speeches. It reminded me of my teacher in middle school, who told a story about how she pursue a dream to go study aboard, how she overcome all the difficulties, and how she enjoyed the process of pursuing a dream. This story also encouraged to have a dream and make an effort on it to make it come true. Until today, I still remember the details of her story and it still encouraged me keep going when I was self-doubting. At some point, she is the first teacher that inspires and leads me to explore and dream.
